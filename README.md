# Keylogger

A keylogger, short for "keystroke logger," is a type of software or hardware device designed to record and log every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device's keyboard. Keyloggers are often used for various legitimate purposes, such as monitoring computer usage, improving user experience, or recovering lost data.
